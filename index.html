      We've heard it all since the pandemic started- lemon juice can kill the coronavirus, masks don't work, if you
      already had <a href="#">Covid-19</a> you can't get it again or that the vaccines approved for emergency use will
      change your DNA
      or put a tracking device in your body.</p> <br>

    <p> It's almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the misinformation. But despite all the
      myths and urban legends, about half the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.</p>
    <p> Wonderful news, right? Wonderful news, right?</p>

    <p> Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up againsta new
      set myths- they're are literally magnetic or they're
      ging to shed vaccine components and alter the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite the extra layer of
      protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else.</p> <br>

    <p>So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread Covid-19 to
      others? Infectious Disease specialist <a href="#">Lyssette Cardona </a>, MD, answers those questions and covers
      why vaccination is
      still one of our best weapons in the fight against Covid-19.
      isn't the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there's still a chance that you could become
      infected. <br><br>
