    <h2 class="firsthead"><span>" Fully vaccinated" </span> doesn't mean "immune to COVID-19"
    </h2>
    <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully
      vaccinated might be feeling
      the return-to normal fantasy. But Dr.Cardona warns that now
      still <video width="400px" height="300px" controls loop>
        <source src="prevention.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      "Fully vaccinated" means that u completed a
      COVID-19
      vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalisations
      and/death.
      No vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give a better chance to fight off the infections
      consequences of being exposed to SARS-CoV2 virus.

    <h2 class="sechead"><span>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, including other vaccinated
        people?
      </span></h2>

    While it is possible Dr.Cardona says the ability to transmitt COVID-19 may occur at lower rate. She adds that
    this
    could also be a reality for people who don"t have a good immune response to vaccines. <br> <br>
    "The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may not
    have the best protective response to vaccine, such COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing
    ongoing research
    about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations."
